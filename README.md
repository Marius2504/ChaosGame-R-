# ChaosGame

## :arrow_forward: Introduction
Chaos Game project for Probabilities and Statistics, taken in 3rd year at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest.

## :memo: Description
In mathematics, the term chaos game originally referred to a method of creating a fractal, using a polygon and an initial point selected at random inside it. The fractal is created by iteratively creating a sequence of points, starting with the initial random point, in which each point in the sequence is a given fraction of the distance between the previous point and one of the vertices of the polygon; the vertex is chosen at random in each iteration. 

## :computer: Scaling
Repeating this iterative process a large number of times, selecting the vertex at random on each iteration, and throwing out the first few points in the sequence, will often (but not always) produce a fractal shape
